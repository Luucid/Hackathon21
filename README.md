# Hackathon21
I decided to go for the game challenge, but because of some things, i lost almost both first days to work at the project, so this is a last day rush thing. But great learning experience as this was my first Unity and C# project.


The theme had to be Krona, Kongsberg.. So a far-fetched attempt to include Krona, i decided the story is this:

You are a student at Krona, and you made a time machine to go back in time and look at the silver mining. The machine broke and you entered an alternate reality where monsters exist. You have to fix your time machine by gathering re-sources you find in the mines.

Stuff i had time to implement:

-The mines are randomly generated.
 
-The player can move and shoot.
 
-The blocks are destructable.
 
-The silver blocks drop silver.
